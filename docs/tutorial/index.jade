      ## Welcome to the tutorial

      This tutorial will walk you through the process of routing callers to options that allow them to put themselves on the do not call list.

      For this tutorial, you'll do most of the work in the Engage Voice UI, but must add the caller to the do not call list using a REST API call.

      ## Get input from the caller using DMTF

      Let's begin by creating a workflow in IVR Studio that answers the call and asks for input from the caller about what they would like to do next. In this property window, we create two DTMF options that can direct the call down one of our two paths. The audio file instructs the caller what their options are and in this case, we have the option to leave a voicemail (1) or be put on the do not call list (2).

      ## Route caller to DNC

      Since the caller elected to be put on the do not call list by pressing "2", we can put them on our DNC list using the REST call.  First click on the "?" and select "2" as the input connection property selection.

      ## Use REST API for DNC list

      Let's configure the REST API call to place this caller on the DNC using their ANI (phone number). We'll need to enter some information like the Type, URL and audio that will play with this action. A JSON body is supplied with the caller's ANI and we'll need a fixed value x-auth-token that will be your own auth token.

      ## Play audio for DNC

      Now configure a Play Audio node to let the caller know that their ANI (phone number) has been place on the do not call list.

      ## Close IVR workflow with hangup

      With the caller's name now on the DNC, and after letting the caller know their name is on the DNC, we can hangup this call.
